* Introduction

- When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
- The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming API for HTML and XML documents.
- It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
- XML presents this data as documents, and the DOM may be used to manage this data.
- With the Document Object Model, programmers can create and build documents, navigate their structure, and add, modify, or delete elements and content.

* What is DOM

- The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
- The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:
- "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."
- In the Document Object Model, documents have a logical structure which is very much like a tree.

* What is the HTML DOM?

- The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:
- The HTML elements as objects
- The properties of all HTML elements
- The methods to access all HTML elements
- The events for all HTML elements

* What it comes from

- The Document Object Model originated as a specification to allow JavaScript scripts and Java programs to be portable among web browsers.
